19
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.040
we had to face water challenge from day

20
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.520
one we don't have enough water so we had

21
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.239
to come out with advanced technologies

22
00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.640
one of them is the drip irrigation

23
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.599
it started with saving water but it

24
00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.239
appeared that if you give the plant the

25
00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.400
exact amount of water you actually

26
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.360
increase its yield

our agate is

33
00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.599
reinforced most of the farmers

34
00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.680
that they wait for the rain

35
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.159
so if there is no rain the farmers are

36
00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:12.240
getting established

38
00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.599
by using israeli advanced technologies

39
00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:19.680
those technologies that improve the life

40
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.400
of the citizens of israel could be used

41
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.640

selling the israeli technologies and

45
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.080
with the support of the program the

46
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.400
ethiopian farmers will see the benefit
