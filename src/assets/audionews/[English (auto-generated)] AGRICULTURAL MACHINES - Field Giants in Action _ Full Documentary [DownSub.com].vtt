it's a bit bumpy because of the tracks

it doesn't drive so well then

45
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.759
but on the field where there's lots of

above all it's the size of the fields

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.159
that makes using the gigantic combine

wide

95

are sometimes in operation day and night

during the harvesting season

111
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.080
the combine harvester has already

112
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.240
undergone the whole range of innovation

113
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.080
it already has most of this agriculture

114
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.560
4.0 in it because it steers by itself it

115
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.160
can measure yields down to the last

116
00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.600
square meter

117
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.759
it can use yield maps and choose its own

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:38.639
power output

119
00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:41.520
that's called cruise pilots that means

120
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.080
it drives

121
00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.400
optimally the combine harvester can

122
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.160
basically determine its own operating

123
00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.720
speed

124
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.080
depending on its throughput this combine

125
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.759
harvester can already do all of that

126
00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:53.280
today

127
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.040
and in the future the combine harvester

128
00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.040
will also be able to adjust itself

129
00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.440
that means it saves its rotor speed it

130
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.720
will basically optimize

131
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.479
all of that so that the driver can

132
00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:04.400
concentrate purely on controlling and

133
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.280
driving the vehicle

134
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.800
the driver has long since become more of

135
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.320
a manager for the machine

136
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.320
and is responsible for ensuring that its

137
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.199
performance is as high as possible

138
00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:19.600
an automatic cruise pilot system helps

139
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.680
him do just that

140
00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.759
it ensures that the combine harvester

141
00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:25.919
constantly operates at its performance

142
00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:26.639
limits

143
00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:30.720
and harvests the maximum area

144
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.440
semi-crawler track units have become the

145
00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.479
norm on the fields infopoman

146
00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:38.880
each of these combine harvesters has a

147
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.960
curb weight of 16.2 metric tons

148
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.039
the special track units make sure that

149
00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:47.120
the giant harvesters do not sink too

150
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.479
deeply into the soil

151
00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:50.840
and therefore offer the fields maximum

152
00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.080
protection

153
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.400
thanks to this technology the high gross

154
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.240
weight of the combine harvesters

155
00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.319
is distributed much better over the

156
00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:01.440
machine's axles

157
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.240
the advantage of the crawler track units

158
00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.680
is that they can carry the heavy weight

159
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:06.319
better

160
00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:08.400
because the headers are big and wide and

161
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.759
if therefore become very heavy

162
00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:14.400
there's no tire that can carry this

163
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.639
weight

164
00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.120
the combine harvesters tank has a

165
00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.880
capacity of thirteen thousand

166
00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.440
five hundred liters and as fast as the

167
00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.560
wheat is harvested

168
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.120
it's transported away from the fields

169
00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:27.840
each year

170
00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.919
twenty thousand metric tons are hauled

171
00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:32.560
by a gas service for pollen alone

172
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.880

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.560
are used to get the job done each of

175
00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.479
them chalks up around 1 000

176
00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:42.880
operating hours a year their high

177
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.400
horsepower is important

178
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.400
to quickly tow the heavy grain trailers

179
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.000
to the farm's on-site grain

180
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.800
store or to the ship waiting in rostock

181
00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:51.840
port

182
00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.440
ninety percent of the wheat from fort

183
00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.440
palman are exported

184
00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.759
often this is a race against time

185
00:06:57.759 --> 00:06:59.599
because harvesting and delivery have to

186
00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:01.360
be completed very quickly

187
00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.280
to be able to keep up with the quality

188
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.039
on the world market

189
00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:07.680
bad weather is the local farmer's worst

190
00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.840
enemy

191
00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.240
did not make number four in macomb we

192
00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.360
have the disadvantage that our

193
00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.280
harvesting season is a bit later than in

194
00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.720
central germany

195
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.720
naturally that increases the risk of

196
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.759
rain

197
00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:21.120
and this is why there's a constant

198
00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.280
demand for increasingly bigger machines

199
00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.199
so that we can deliver even faster in

200
00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:27.280
this short harvesting period

201
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:31.360
so and that means everything has to be

202
00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.919
spot on when harvesting begins

203
00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:36.080
the team heads out but not the whole

204
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.039
team

205
00:07:37.039 --> 00:07:38.880
unfortunately one of the combine

206
00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.880
harvesters has broken down

207
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.039
the employees are working hard to repair

208
00:07:43.039 --> 00:07:45.039
it they're pushed for time

209
00:07:45.039 --> 00:07:47.280
because rain has been forecast for this

210
00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.960
evening and the harvest

211
00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.759
has to be brought in dry ultra modern

212
00:07:51.759 --> 00:07:53.599
technology doesn't always mean

213
00:07:53.599 --> 00:07:59.680
that it functions all the time

214
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.039
yesterday we discovered that the

215
00:08:01.039 --> 00:08:03.120
variator on top was completely loose in

216
00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.160
the shaft

217
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.240
the thrust washer has gone the bearing

218
00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.199
was broken

219
00:08:07.199 --> 00:08:09.599
that means the shaft is worn so we've

220
00:08:09.599 --> 00:08:11.280
had to replace the entire bearing as

221
00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.759
well as the variator and the shaft

222
00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:15.759
we've had to repair everything again and

223
00:08:15.759 --> 00:08:17.840
service it and it's difficult of course

224
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.280
right now in the final phase of

225
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.160
harvesting

226
00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.039
when we really have to get a move on but

227
00:08:23.039 --> 00:08:24.319
we'll get it done

228
00:08:24.319 --> 00:08:25.599
it's just dumb because you have the

229
00:08:25.599 --> 00:08:27.599
weather to contend with too but we'll do

230
00:08:27.599 --> 00:08:29.680
it

231
00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.880
the outlook is good

232
00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:36.958
the team worked through the night and

233
00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:41.838
got everything prepared

234
00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.920
there's a big parts warehouse there a

235
00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.680
logistics center for this product

236
00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.200
i picked the replacement part up there

237
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.640
and drove back here so that we can

238
00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:51.440
reinstall it

239
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.959
and get the machine back on the field

240
00:08:52.959 --> 00:08:55.440
again it's very important for us that we

241
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.200
can get replacement parts quickly

242
00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.880
and can then fit them ourselves or in

243
00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.640
conjunction with the dealer so we can

244
00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.240
make sure that the machine is always

245
00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.720
operational

246
00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.440
two hours later the harvester is back on

247
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.200
the field again

248
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.959
the race against the impending reign

249
00:09:10.959 --> 00:09:12.959
appears to have been won

250
00:09:12.959 --> 00:09:14.959
but then another problem crops up for

251
00:09:14.959 --> 00:09:16.720
yen's mullah

252
00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.600
this is the last thing he needs there's

253
00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:23.839
something wrong with the header

254
00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:28.420
[Music]

255
00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.040
a cutter has broken off making it

256
00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.279
difficult to collect the grain

257
00:09:35.279 --> 00:09:37.200
but the harvester driver has the right

258
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.800
tool on board

259
00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.920
what exactly happened

260
00:09:42.399 --> 00:09:43.760
well i could see that the wheat was

261
00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:47.040
getting stuck at the front in the header

262
00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.839
and then it no longer bites into it

263
00:09:48.839 --> 00:09:51.839
properly

264
00:09:57.279 --> 00:09:59.360
each malfunction during harvesting is

265
00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.120
immediately reported to managing

266
00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:04.000
director carsten stegelmann

267
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.079
but he can already see that his employee

268
00:10:06.079 --> 00:10:07.200
has the situation

269
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.160
under control even small things can have

270
00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:14.399
major impacts on the high-tech machines

271
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.880
i think it says the cutting technology

272
00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.720
is set so that it overlaps

273
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.079
that means that each cutter has a

274
00:10:20.079 --> 00:10:22.079
specific function here and is used to

275
00:10:22.079 --> 00:10:23.120
cut off each stalk

276
00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.360
geared to the vehicle speed if one is

277
00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.279
missing it creates congestion

278
00:10:27.279 --> 00:10:29.279
then everything is pushed forward it

279
00:10:29.279 --> 00:10:30.399
isn't cut off properly

280
00:10:30.399 --> 00:10:33.839
and the cutter has to be replaced

281
00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.880
it's also big contractors like kasten

282
00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:37.760
stegelmann

283
00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.920
that make their way to hanover every two

284
00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.519
years

285
00:10:41.519 --> 00:10:43.760
this is where the world's leading trade

286
00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.000
fair for agricultural machinery takes

287
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.279
place it's attended by almost

288
00:10:49.279 --> 00:10:51.519
half a million visitors looking for

289
00:10:51.519 --> 00:11:01.839
ideas for future purchases

290
00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.200
a new generation of combine harvesters

291
00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.279
is attracting particular attention in

292
00:11:11.279 --> 00:11:13.200
hanover

293
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.360
this model is one of the most powerful

294
00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.600
combine harvesters in the world

295
00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:21.680
and has a 13.8 meter header

296
00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.600
precision and efficiency are the

297
00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.959
buzzwords used

298
00:11:24.959 --> 00:11:27.360
to market this gigantic harvester around

299
00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.800
the globe

300
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.519
with its 790 horsepower truck engine

301
00:11:31.519 --> 00:11:32.640
from man

302
00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:35.440
it can harvest up to 44 metric tons of

303
00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:36.560
cereals in just

304
00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.839
one hour the high performance combine

305
00:11:39.839 --> 00:11:41.440
harvester storage tanks

306
00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.839
can hold up to eighteen thousand liters

307
00:11:43.839 --> 00:11:46.240
of grain

308
00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.120
klausheva is part of the development

309
00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.760
team and is very proud of his work

310
00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.920
but where can this technology which

311
00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.839
comes with a price tag of around one

312
00:12:01.839 --> 00:12:03.040
million euros

313
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.200
be operated and who are the massive

314
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.240
combine harvesters

315
00:12:09.519 --> 00:12:11.120
it's customers by large farms or big

316
00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.399
contracting companies that have to

317
00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:13.760
harvest large areas

318
00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.440
these are large scale operations in the

319
00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.200
north in the east that cultivate several

320
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.240
thousand hectares

321
00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.600
and run very professional crop

322
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.519
production operations they want to

323
00:12:21.519 --> 00:12:23.440
harvest large areas as efficiently as

324
00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:25.279
possible in a short space of time

325
00:12:25.279 --> 00:12:27.519
with very few staff in order to feed us

326
00:12:27.519 --> 00:12:29.120
all with our breakfast roll in the

327
00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.480
morning and a glass of beer in the

328
00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:32.800
evening

329
00:12:33.279 --> 00:12:35.040
this new generation of combine

330
00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.279
harvesters which is being launched with

331
00:12:37.279 --> 00:12:38.399
13 models

332
00:12:38.399 --> 00:12:41.920
contains around 54 000 parts

333
00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.240
it's a technical highlight because these

334
00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.160
agricultural machines are fitted with

335
00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.079
numerous digital components

336
00:12:48.079 --> 00:12:51.120
making them particularly efficient it

337
00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.880
harvests 25

338
00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.600
more efficiently than its predecessor

339
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.360
this means that the new combine

340
00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.600
harvester can thresh one metric ton of

341
00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.200
grain in less than a minute

342
00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.440
using the energy from just one liter of

343
00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:05.040
diesel

344
00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.040
this translates into enough grain to

345
00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.120
produce over 1 million bread rolls

346
00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:12.000
within a single hour

347
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.720
first and foremost this is made possible

348
00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:17.760
by the extreme width of the header

349
00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.880
at almost 14 meters have the limits of

350
00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:21.920
what is feasible

351
00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.720
now been reached

352
00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.399
that reminds me of my father 40 years

353
00:13:28.399 --> 00:13:29.680
ago he said

354
00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:32.000
man at 5.10 meters they can't get any

355
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:32.880
bigger

356
00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.920
and now we've reached 13.8 meters

357
00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.720
12 meters has already become normal yes

358
00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.399
it's the biggest harvester in the world

359
00:13:40.399 --> 00:13:41.360
right now

360
00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:42.720
but there'll be further developments

361
00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.720
over the next 20 years and we'll see

362
00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:49.839
even bigger and more powerful machines

363
00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.440
what are called terratrak crawler track

364
00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.240
systems

365
00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.240
were already available for the new top

366
00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:58.240
model's predecessor

367
00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.399
this drive system is based on tracks

368
00:14:00.399 --> 00:14:01.760
rather than tires

369
00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.920
and is now also widespread in corn

370
00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:05.600
harvesting

371
00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.760
the rubber tracks distribute the ever

372
00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.760
increasing weight of the machines better

373
00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.720
and reduce ground pressure this results

374
00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.639
in longer operating times

375
00:14:14.639 --> 00:14:16.880
even under difficult conditions and

376
00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:20.160
lowers fuel consumption

377
00:14:20.399 --> 00:14:22.800
however freight forwarders like joachim

378
00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:23.839
ferenkota

379
00:14:23.839 --> 00:14:25.839
have difficulty loading these powerful

380
00:14:25.839 --> 00:14:27.600
harvesters

381
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.160
with 180 trucks his company is

382
00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.079
specialized in transporting large

383
00:14:32.079 --> 00:14:34.800
agricultural machines if only it weren't

384
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.560
for the dimensions

385
00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.480
the machines have to be transported to

386
00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.760
the dealers

387
00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.079
throughout europe this is becoming

388
00:14:42.079 --> 00:14:43.600
increasingly difficult

389
00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.519
because the enormous harvesters are

390
00:14:45.519 --> 00:14:46.959
often extra wide

391
00:14:46.959 --> 00:14:48.560
and are also higher than the legal

392
00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:51.680
limits permit the company therefore uses

393
00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.519
special semi-trailers that can be

394
00:14:53.519 --> 00:14:55.600
lowered right down to the ground

395
00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.320
this is what enables these giants to be

396
00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.199
transported

397
00:14:59.199 --> 00:15:02.639
on the road the machine is already

398
00:15:02.639 --> 00:15:04.240
around four meters high due to its

399
00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.079
design so it has to get down as low as

400
00:15:06.079 --> 00:15:07.920
possible

401
00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.600
that means we now have about four or

402
00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:12.480
five centimeters of ground clearance

403
00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.160
later the driver will raise the machine

404
00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.519
a little so that he has a ground

405
00:15:15.519 --> 00:15:18.240
clearance of around 10 centimeters

406
00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.600
and then he'll drive so that we don't

407
00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.680
exceed around the 4 meter 20 mark at the

408
00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:22.079
top

409
00:15:22.079 --> 00:15:24.880
depending on what it says in the permit

410
00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:26.000
but the dimensions

411
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.040
are by no means the only problem the

412
00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.959
permissible gross vehicle weight

413
00:15:30.959 --> 00:15:33.440
of 40 metric tons can't be exceeded

414
00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.360
either

415
00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.079
weeks with full equipment this combine

416
00:15:38.079 --> 00:15:40.079
harvester has a curb weight of 25

417
00:15:40.079 --> 00:15:43.120
metric tons and 25 metric tons

418
00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.440
means the tractor unit and semi-trailer

419
00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:48.000
can't weigh any more than 15 metric tons

420
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.320
and that's a real challenge so you have

421
00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.800
to save weight wherever you can

422
00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.639
aluminium wheels and special technology

423
00:15:54.639 --> 00:15:56.399
such as a steered rear axle

424
00:15:56.399 --> 00:15:58.160
that's actuated electronically rather

425
00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.519
than mechanically

426
00:15:59.519 --> 00:16:01.440
naturally the tractor unit has to be

427
00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:02.880
particularly light

428
00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.480
so of course you always have to think

429
00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.800
about the driver in terms of comfort

430
00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.720
if i use a narrow cab the driver might

431
00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.320
have a space problem but i need every

432
00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.600
kilogram

433
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.240
here is kilo

434
00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.600
performance efficiency and also safety

435
00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.000
requirements are crucial when buying new

436
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.279
tractors

437
00:16:21.279 --> 00:16:23.279
overall tractors are among the best

438
00:16:23.279 --> 00:16:25.199
selling vehicles on the agricultural

439
00:16:25.199 --> 00:16:26.240
market

440
00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.959
even the 400 horsepower mark has long

441
00:16:28.959 --> 00:16:30.720
since been surpassed

442
00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.199
roughly 30 000 new tractors are sold

443
00:16:33.199 --> 00:16:34.560
each year in germany

444
00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:37.519
with sales of around 180 000 new

445
00:16:37.519 --> 00:16:39.360
vehicles throughout europe

446
00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.920
above all german and french companies

447
00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:42.880
are noticeably

448
00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:51.839
willing to invest

449
00:16:52.079 --> 00:16:54.399
german manufacturers like this machine

450
00:16:54.399 --> 00:16:56.399
factory in the emsland region

451
00:16:56.399 --> 00:16:58.560
are particularly benefiting from the

452
00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.560
shift to increasingly bigger and

453
00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:03.839
more powerful agricultural machines

454
00:17:03.839 --> 00:17:06.160
thanks to high quality and innovations

455
00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.000
the company has transformed

456
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.319
from a small blacksmith shop into a

457
00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:12.240
global supplier

458
00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.880
agricultural technology made in germany

459
00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:17.199
occupies a leading position in virtually

460
00:17:17.199 --> 00:17:18.640
all sectors

461
00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.799
and the manufacturers are constantly

462
00:17:20.799 --> 00:17:22.480
coming up with new products

463
00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.039
that attract international attention

464
00:17:25.039 --> 00:17:26.959
such as this high-speed baler

465
00:17:26.959 --> 00:17:30.840
which has actually won a prize for its

466
00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:32.980
design

467
00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:36.059
[Music]

468
00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:41.440
this forage harvester is the best seller

469
00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:45.360
it has an output of up to 1156

470
00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.480
horsepower

471
00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.280
and is used for harvesting corn on every

472
00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:50.640
continent

473
00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.799
the flagship model is now one of the

474
00:17:52.799 --> 00:17:53.679
most powerful

475
00:17:53.679 --> 00:17:56.000
agricultural machines in the world and

476
00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.679
is even in action in china

477
00:17:57.679 --> 00:18:01.280
brazil and chile so it's a real top

478
00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.679
seller

479
00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.120
agricultural machinery has been changing

480
00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.600
at an increasingly faster pace for some

481
00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:12.799
years

482
00:18:12.799 --> 00:18:14.799
the number of farming operations is

483
00:18:14.799 --> 00:18:16.320
constantly declining

484
00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:17.840
while the remaining farms are

485
00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:21.120
cultivating increasingly larger areas

486
00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.360
but only powerful machines are able to

487
00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:24.240
harvest these

488
00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.760
in the tight time frames that are

489
00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:28.000
available effectiveness

490
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
is the magic formula for ensuring

491
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.559
survival

492
00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.799
many farmers are turning to contracting

493
00:18:38.799 --> 00:18:39.760
companies

494
00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:41.919
because the expensive technology is

495
00:18:41.919 --> 00:18:44.160
proving to be cost effective for fewer

496
00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.640
and fewer farms

497
00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.880
they then carry out the sewing and field

498
00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:50.320
work

499
00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:52.160
there are around three thousand such

500
00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.760
companies in germany

501
00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.960
like fergadin in the minsterland region

502
00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.200
american tractors with an output of

503
00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.919
between 240 and 300 horsepower

504
00:19:01.919 --> 00:19:05.039
are in action here these each cost a

505
00:19:05.039 --> 00:19:05.600
minimum

506
00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:09.120
of 180 000 euros and also

507
00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:11.280
a latest generation corn chopper with

508
00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:13.760
900 horsepower

509
00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.000
this forage harvester which costs around

510
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.440
half a million euros

511
00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:19.919
and is working for a biogas company is

512
00:19:19.919 --> 00:19:20.640
called

513
00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:24.400
bad bull

514
00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.799
half a million euros is a lot of money

515

for a single harvesting machine

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.039
the machines have to be in operation for

517
00:19:31.039 --> 00:19:33.520
a long time to pay for themselves

521
00:19:39.919 --> 00:19:42.400
10 to 15 years and we're constantly

522
00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:43.760
replacing them

523
00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.360
of course the big machines are packed

full of technology and electronics

525
00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:49.520
and of course all that has to be paid

for

527
00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.200
unfortunately for the contractor without

these expensive investments

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:56.559
we wouldn't be around any longer if we

530

didn't invest in this technology

[Music]

532
00:20:02.159 --> 00:20:04.799
productivity was the deciding factor for

533
00:20:04.799 --> 00:20:06.640
this major purchase

534
00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.880
the more horsepower a forage harvester

535
00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.200
has the higher its throughput

536
00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.840
meaning the amount that it can harvest

537
00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:15.840
with its seven and a half meter wide

header

539
00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.640
the chopper can manage around 300 metric

540
00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:20.480
tons of corn in one hour

541
00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:23.120
at full load it consumes around 200

liters of diesel per hour

543
00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:28.159

concerned with the machine's performance

00:20:36.159 --> 00:20:37.919
i've been driving forage harvesters for

548
00:20:37.919 --> 00:20:40.240
about 35 years now

549
00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.840
the horsepower is always important when

550
00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.760
you're harvesting corn

551
00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:45.520
and the number of rows or the width of

552
00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:47.120
the header of course

553
00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.039
and if the header is wider you need more

554
00:20:49.039 --> 00:20:50.880
horsepower simply because of the mass

555
00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:52.290
that has to be chopped

here corn is used to produce biogas

558
00:20:57.679 --> 00:21:00.320
so the cereal is not fed to livestock

559
00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:03.520
but is instead used to generate energy

the fermentation process undergone by

the chopped plant

562
00:21:06.799 --> 00:21:09.440
subsequently produces combustible gas

563
00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:11.360

70s at the time we had a tractor with 35

675
00:25:41.039 --> 00:25:42.799
and we used a two-row corn chopper that

676

was hitched to a tractor

converted grain trainers

679
00:25:47.279 --> 00:25:50.559

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.640
that means different corn varieties

687
00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.720
because the corn is then easier for the

688
00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.559
livestock to digest

689
00:26:10.559 --> 00:26:12.559
machine demonstrations have long since

690
00:26:12.559 --> 00:26:14.000
become a sales tool for the

691
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.840
manufacturers

692
00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:18.000
and where better to do that than on the

693
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.120
field

694
00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:22.000
the jaguar 950 with around 600

695
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:22.799
horsepower

696
00:26:22.799 --> 00:26:25.360
is being presented it's one of the top

697
00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:27.360
selling choppers in the world

698
00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:31.679
but why is this harvester called jaguar

699
00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.799
might the feline predator's name have

700
00:26:34.799 --> 00:26:38.240
something to do with the engine

701
00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.120
no there's no jaguar engine in it the

702
00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:43.520
machine has a mercedes engine

703
00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:46.080
for anything over 700 horsepower we fit

704
00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:47.440
man engines

705
00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:50.799
but up to 625 horsepower we use mercedes

706
00:26:50.799 --> 00:26:52.960
engines

707
00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.640
the name jaguar is used because it's

708
00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.240
become established at class

709
00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.919
and the choppers have been called jaguar

710
00:26:57.919 --> 00:27:00.559
for decades

711
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.400
knows that the chopper is top quality

712
00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.440
but first of all

713
00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.760
he sets off for an extensive test drive

714
00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.120
on the field

715
00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:13.520
this high-tech machine also costs around

716
00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:15.279
half a million euros

717
00:27:15.279 --> 00:27:17.520
the demonstrator vehicle has everything

718
00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:19.200
on board that a contractor could

719
00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.559
possibly want

720
00:27:20.559 --> 00:27:24.240
including autopilot and gps technology

721
00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:26.240
the driver sits in a kind of command

722
00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:28.880
center the multifunction handle

723
00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:32.320
is his best friend the 13 metric ton

724
00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:34.320
chopper's gigantic fuel tank

725
00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:37.440
can hold over 1 000 liters of diesel

726
00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:40.000
a 300 liter auxiliary tank is also

727
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.760
available if needed

728
00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:44.720
more than enough for hours of work

729
00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:45.600
naturally

730
00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:48.320
the jaguar forager also complies with

731
00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:50.559
the latest emission standards

732
00:27:50.559 --> 00:27:52.960
because they use truck engines adblue

733
00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:54.880
has also long since found its way into

734
00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:55.840
choppers

735
00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.240
but which criteria does a company use as

736
00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:02.000
the basis for buying technology

737
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.080
like buying a car there's several brands

738
00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.200
whether you're talking about audi

739
00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.880
mercedes or bmw

740
00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:08.000
we have class and there's other

741
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.159
manufacturers too we've been working

742
00:28:10.159 --> 00:28:11.679
together with class for a long time and

743
00:28:11.679 --> 00:28:13.120
we're very satisfied

744
00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.799
also because of the workshop the whole

745
00:28:14.799 --> 00:28:16.399
service including replacement parts

746
00:28:16.399 --> 00:28:17.120
supply

747
00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:19.120
of course operating reliability is also

748
00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:21.279
important particularly for our customers

749
00:28:21.279 --> 00:28:22.640
that means it's also important that the

750
00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:24.159
machines constantly function well and

751
00:28:24.159 --> 00:28:26.799
the whole concept fits

752
00:28:26.799 --> 00:28:29.279
the demonstration vehicle is slowly put

753
00:28:29.279 --> 00:28:30.880
through its paces

754
00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:33.279
at the same time it has to be made sure

755
00:28:33.279 --> 00:28:36.399
that chopping itself is running properly

756
00:28:36.399 --> 00:28:38.880
today however no purchase decision is

757
00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.880
made by the contractor

758
00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:42.960
something that is by no means unusual

759
00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.180
for an investment of this magnitude

760
00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:52.960
[Music]

761
00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:55.440
back to foiphoman where the fields have

762
00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:57.520
to be prepared for sowing rapeseed

763
00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:59.840
immediately after harvesting

764
00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:02.799
the 600 horsepower case quad track one

765
00:29:02.799 --> 00:29:04.399
of only five in germany

766
00:29:04.399 --> 00:29:07.360
is once again in operation it's hauling

767
00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:09.919
a gigantic cultivator which is used

768
00:29:09.919 --> 00:29:13.840
to loosen the soil

769
00:29:15.039 --> 00:29:16.640
this gives us various options for

770
00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.799
cultivating the soil firstly down to a

771
00:29:18.799 --> 00:29:20.640
depth of around 10 centimeters

772
00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.080
and then deep of course in the range

773
00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:24.159
down to 30 centimeters

774
00:29:24.159 --> 00:29:26.000
this is done to properly loosen the soil

775
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.600
and get it ready for sowing

776
00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.440
so that we can sow rapeseed which is

777
00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:32.320
what we're doing right now

778
00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:35.679
with a dead weight of 25 metric tons

779
00:29:35.679 --> 00:29:38.080
the extreme tractor pulls the 8 meter

780
00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:40.159
wide deep cultivator behind it

781
00:29:40.159 --> 00:29:43.120
as if it were dragging a toy tractor

782
00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:43.600
driver

783
00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.840
frank zieffeld is clearly enjoying his

784
00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:47.039
work

785
00:29:47.039 --> 00:29:49.279
off the field the tractor vehicle can do

786
00:29:49.279 --> 00:29:51.679
almost 40 kilometers per hour

787
00:29:51.679 --> 00:29:53.600
but what's important is what the tracks

788
00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:57.039
can do on the field

789
00:29:58.159 --> 00:30:00.159
the crawler track units enable us to use

790
00:30:00.159 --> 00:30:01.919
very big implements without harming the

791
00:30:01.919 --> 00:30:02.640
soil

792
00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.640
and also to achieve a productivity of

793
00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:08.720
around three to seven hectares per hour

794
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.320
even bigger machines are being used more

795
00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:15.520
than anything else

796
00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:18.559
to increase yields in agriculture but

797
00:30:18.559 --> 00:30:20.320
they also pose risks

798
00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:22.880
because the technology is often unwieldy

799
00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:23.919
due to its sheer

800
00:30:23.919 --> 00:30:27.279
size starting with the tractors

801
00:30:27.279 --> 00:30:29.200
if the tractors have a maximum speed of

802
00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.799
40 kilometers per hour

803
00:30:30.799 --> 00:30:33.039
they can even be driven by 16 year olds

804
00:30:33.039 --> 00:30:34.559
with a tractor permit

805
00:30:34.559 --> 00:30:36.799
no matter how heavy or how large the

806
00:30:36.799 --> 00:30:38.720
attachment implements or the tractor

807
00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.799
itself are

808
00:30:40.799 --> 00:30:43.279
the result is an unusually high number

809
00:30:43.279 --> 00:30:45.200
of young tractor drivers involved in

810
00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:46.640
accidents

811
00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:48.399
the cause of this is their lack of

812
00:30:48.399 --> 00:30:51.039
experience because not even a practical

813
00:30:51.039 --> 00:30:52.880
driving permit test is officially

814
00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:53.520
required

815
00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:56.720
to drive the tractors but since

816
00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:58.640
harvesting often falls in the vacation

817
00:30:58.640 --> 00:30:59.279
period

818
00:30:59.279 --> 00:31:01.679
many farms are forced to rely on such

819
00:31:01.679 --> 00:31:05.840
inexperienced drivers

820
00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:07.760
it's a really difficult business of

821
00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:09.279
course we're totally dependent on the

822
00:31:09.279 --> 00:31:09.919
weather

823
00:31:09.919 --> 00:31:11.120
and to find the right people in the

824
00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:13.039
right place is very difficult they're

825
00:31:13.039 --> 00:31:16.080
often on the telephone day and night

826
00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:18.080
and you have to try to get every able

827
00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:19.679
body that you can

828
00:31:19.679 --> 00:31:23.279
become a potential accident risk

829
00:31:23.279 --> 00:31:26.240
is lurking in the dark tractors not only

830
00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:28.399
travel at relatively high speeds

831
00:31:28.399 --> 00:31:31.600
but also usually in convoys

832
00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:34.559
and they need a lot of room many car

833
00:31:34.559 --> 00:31:35.120
drivers

834
00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:37.919
underestimate these hazards particularly

835
00:31:37.919 --> 00:31:40.080
when overtaking

836
00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:42.159
the large machines pose an additional

837
00:31:42.159 --> 00:31:44.320
risk due to their sharp edged and

838
00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:46.480
pointed headers

839
00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:48.399
this is why the law states that they

840
00:31:48.399 --> 00:31:50.000
have to be either folded up

841
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.399
or transported on trailers when driving

842
00:31:52.399 --> 00:32:00.399
on the road

843
00:32:00.399 --> 00:32:02.799
this crash test shows how quickly a

844
00:32:02.799 --> 00:32:05.039
combine harvester can become a deadly

845
00:32:05.039 --> 00:32:05.840
obstacle

846
00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:08.320
and how powerless other road users are

847
00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:11.120
against these working machines

848
00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:13.360
a motorcycle rider impacts laterally

849
00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:15.279
against the tire at a speed of 60

850
00:32:15.279 --> 00:32:17.120
kilometers per hour

851
00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:20.480
his chance of surviving is slim

852
00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.559
in the second crash test a head-on

853
00:32:22.559 --> 00:32:24.159
collision with the mowing unit is

854
00:32:24.159 --> 00:32:25.519
simulated

855
00:32:25.519 --> 00:32:27.679
this collision with a motorcycle rider

856
00:32:27.679 --> 00:32:31.200
would certainly prove fatal

857
00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:39.600
even when the header has been removed

858
00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:41.679
frontal collisions with car drivers are

859
00:32:41.679 --> 00:32:43.679
always a deadly hazard

860
00:32:43.679 --> 00:32:46.080
harvesting machines are not designed for

861
00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:48.960
use on roads

862
00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:53.440
let's return to the size of modern

863
00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:54.960
harvesting technology

864
00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.039
and the question of what else is being

865
00:32:57.039 --> 00:32:58.240
attempted to achieve

866
00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:01.679
even greater efficiency

867
00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:03.919
as the tractors are constantly having to

868
00:33:03.919 --> 00:33:05.279
pull heavier loads

869
00:33:05.279 --> 00:33:09.600
the trailers have also grown in size

870
00:33:09.679 --> 00:33:12.000
they have long since reached dimensions

871
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.760
that are in no way comparable with

872
00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:15.840
earlier models

873
00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:18.159
however the legally specified weight

874
00:33:18.159 --> 00:33:18.880
classes

875
00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:21.279
still have to be adhered to which is why

876
00:33:21.279 --> 00:33:24.480
even trucks are now being used

877
00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:26.080
but because there are limits to the

878
00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:28.080
tonnage lightweight parts are

879
00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:30.320
particularly important

880
00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:32.640
however the harvest is also being

881
00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:33.600
transported over

882
00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:36.399
increasingly long distances trucks are

883
00:33:36.399 --> 00:33:37.519
therefore being used

884
00:33:37.519 --> 00:33:39.279

often contractors already have trucks

887
00:33:45.679 --> 00:33:46.960
anyway and that's why they're

888
00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:48.720
increasingly being used for transport

with half pipes

890
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.840
not only for delivering slurry but also

for transporting signage etc

each part with straps

921

chains blocks or wedges because the

922
00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:53.359
weight of the cargo doesn't change the

923
00:34:53.359 --> 00:34:55.359
fact that the machines could suddenly

924
00:34:55.359 --> 00:34:57.839
start to move during braking

925
00:34:57.839 --> 00:35:00.240
everything has to be done precisely so

926
00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:01.599
that the expensive freight

927
00:35:01.599 --> 00:35:03.780
reaches its destination unscathed

[Music]

929
00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:08.240
there's no comparison to driving a

930
00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:10.400
refrigerated or curtain semi-trailer

931
00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.680
because you have different dimensions

932
00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:13.440
and a different cargo every day

933
00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:15.520
you have to load differently every day

934
00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:17.119
and you have to do a lot of work in your

935
00:35:17.119 --> 00:35:18.880
head in this area

936
00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:20.320
it's not just a case of opening the

937
00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:22.079

and off you go that's not possible here

941
00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:28.480
so this is a very specialized area where

we need and i have to save professionals

large machines mean big challenges and

946
00:35:37.359 --> 00:35:38.160
above all

is still something very special for him

951
00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.480
according to jurgen

952
00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:52.640
these are very relaxed people who are

953
00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:54.720
genuinely pleased to see the truck and

954
00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:55.839
its load

955
00:35:55.839 --> 00:35:58.560
a hectic pace is therefore a very poor

956
00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:00.160
companion when transporting the

957
00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:01.920
expensive technology

958
00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:04.079
the reason being that the load is extra

959
00:36:04.079 --> 00:36:06.560
wide and particular care on the road is

960
00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:08.800
therefore absolutely crucial

961
00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:11.520
and of course the cargo can also work

962
00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:12.000
itself

963
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.079
loose over hundreds of kilometers

964
00:36:14.079 --> 00:36:16.400
despite being carefully secured

965
00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.880
therefore the driver also uses his

966
00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:21.150
regular stops for inspections

967
00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:24.160
[Music]

968
00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:25.599
yeah to make sure that the straps are

969
00:36:25.599 --> 00:36:27.520
taut and that the load is still fixed in

970
00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:27.920
place

971
00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:29.680
and is not now lying loose in the cargo

972
00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:31.119
bed because the straps have stretched

973
00:36:31.119 --> 00:36:32.560
and come loose

974
00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:33.920
and you also have a responsibility

975
00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.359
towards the customer and other road

976
00:36:35.359 --> 00:36:36.400
users

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:50.240
look like gigantic ants and are leaving

1078
00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:31.359
i don't know whether a farmer will go

buy this because he knows very well

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:38.079
two to three thousand hours the thing's

1084

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:42.880

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:44.640
throwing your money out of the window so

1087
00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:47.920
no way i wouldn't do it but

1088
00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:50.560
buying a used large tractor in an age of

1089

leasing contracts

1090

1092
00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:58.240

no costly repairs crop

1094
00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:02.720
up afterwards so auctions like this

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:05.119
always involve an element of risk

1096
00:41:05.119 --> 00:41:07.200
but when prices are low the used

1097
00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:08.640
vehicle's high horsepower

1098
00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:11.680

customers come from all over the world

1100
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.319

certainly looking for the big machines

the new ones are so expensive that a lot

of farmers just can't afford them

but the used ones are much more within

the farmers reach of course

1108

they dream about them they want them and

sensitive potato tubers

1163
00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:36.640
so that the technology doesn't take up

too much space on the road

driver is relieved of

1195
00:44:45.359 --> 00:44:48.560
all manual tasks incredible but thanks

1196
00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:50.079
to its modern technology

1197
00:44:50.079 --> 00:44:52.079
the machine can complete all of the

1198
00:44:52.079 --> 00:44:53.440
harvesting work

1199
00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:56.720
virtually on its own

[Music]

1201
00:45:03.119 --> 00:45:05.520
an articulated joint ensures that the

1202
00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:07.839
gigantic harvesting machine remains

1203
00:45:07.839 --> 00:45:08.560
agile

1204
00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:11.440
despite its empty weight of 34 metric

1205

tons

1206
00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:16.720
and its length of 15.6 meters

1207
00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:20.240
its beating heart is a 653 horsepower

truck engine

1209

[Music]

1212
00:45:31.359 --> 00:45:32.880
as the strategy element of our machine

1213
00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:35.280
the engine is a very important component

1214
00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:36.800
we sell the machines on the global

1215
00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:39.520
market in 120 different countries

1216
00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:41.280
and of course not only in areas where

1217
00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:43.520
there are major cities and metropolises

1218
00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:47.040
but also in rural areas

1219
00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:48.720
so it's extremely important that we have

1220
00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:50.720
the capability to be able to service

1221
00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:54.560
this 650 horsepower engine

1222
00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:56.240
and that's pretty much guaranteed

1223
00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:58.800
worldwide with mercedes with mtu

1224
00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:00.160
because they're part of the truck

1225
00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:02.000
industry and have the engines

1226
00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.040
replacement parts

1227
00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:05.200

beet

1233
00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:17.440
but the tiger 6s model has a bit more

1234
00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:19.359
horsepower

1235
00:46:19.359 --> 00:46:21.839
this enables the powerful beet harvester

1236
00:46:21.839 --> 00:46:22.880
to cope with

1237
00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:25.839

specifically for the flagship

1243
00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:43.920
this reduces the machine's roll by about

1244
00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:45.839
65 percent

1245
00:46:45.839 --> 00:46:48.560
with increased daily outputs and reduced

1246
00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:49.839
operating costs

1247
00:46:49.839 --> 00:46:51.760
the company is hoping to establish the

1248
00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:54.560
tiger on beat fields around the globe

1249
00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:56.400
so that the driver also feels right at

1250
00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:58.560
home work was additionally done on the

1251

cabin equipment

1252
00:47:00.319 --> 00:47:01.920
while there's still some way to go

1253
00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:03.839
before the beet harvester resembles a

1254
00:47:03.839 --> 00:47:04.720
spaceship

1255
00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:07.599
the spacey computerized workplace shows

1256
00:47:07.599 --> 00:47:08.160
how far

1257
00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:11.200
digitalization has progressed each phase

1258
00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:12.000
of harvesting

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.000
is seamlessly documented for the client

1260
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.480
for quality control networked cameras on

1261
00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:19.440
the cabin roof

1262
00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:21.839
supply images of the beet crop before

1263
00:47:21.839 --> 00:47:25.040
and after harvesting remote diagnosis

1264
00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:27.040
enables service technicians to access

1265
00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:28.800
the machine control system

1266
00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:30.720
and help the driver in the event of

1267
00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:33.200
problems

1268
00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:34.960
we're entering a new era in our sector

1269
00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:36.240
with this machine

1270
00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:39.359
because it's completely networked this

1271
00:47:39.359 --> 00:47:40.079
machine has

1272
00:47:40.079 --> 00:47:42.960
integrated telematics it has a sim card

1273
00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:46.160
that's connected to our online portal

1274
00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:48.160
this acts as the basis for networking

1275
00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:50.800
the machine and the online portal

1276
00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:52.960
where

1277
00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:01.280
and where our service department can

1278
00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:04.839
help our drivers and customers in the

1279
00:48:04.839 --> 00:48:07.839
future

1280
00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:11.839
but this technology also comes at a

1281
00:48:11.839 --> 00:48:12.720
price

1282
00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:16.160
around 600 000 euros an amount

1283
00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:18.480
that many customers can only invest if

1284
00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:20.000
the tiger is in operation

1285
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.359
virtually around the clock no problem

1286
00:48:23.359 --> 00:48:25.520
because this machine even turns night

1287
00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:27.760
into day with its special power

1288
00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:30.720
led lighting

1289
00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:34.400
the mood among the manufacturers is good

1290
00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:36.880
this is particularly due to increasing

1291
00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:37.440
interest

1292
00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:39.599
in high quality foodstuffs that are

1293
00:48:39.599 --> 00:48:40.640
needed to feed

1294
00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:43.680
even more people

1295
00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:46.079
worldwide grain production is already

1296
00:48:46.079 --> 00:48:49.760
unable to keep pace with consumption

1297
00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:52.079
highly effective harvesting technology

1298
00:48:52.079 --> 00:48:54.319
is helping farmers

1299
00:48:54.319 --> 00:49:03.839
to increase their productivity
